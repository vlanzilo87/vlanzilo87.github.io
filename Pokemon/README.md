Pokémon Stats

To build this application I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. To start I drew a wireframe design which I ended up changing as I was working. I started with the HTML file then JavaScript and finally CSS. After making changes, I would check them in the browser then edit as needed. I would like to make this app more responsive on a mobile interface. I would also like an API with clearer images of Pokémon.
